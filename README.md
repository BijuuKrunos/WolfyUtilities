### WolfyUtilities
###### _by WolfyScript_
##
This API is the core that powers all of my plugins (right now only CustomCrafting).

##### WolfyUtilities contains a lot of useful APIs, such as:
- **InventoryAPI** to create in-game GUIs (_going to be rewritten soon!_)
- **ConfigAPI** to easily manage your configs needs. It supports _YAML_ and _JSON_
- **LanguageAPI** that allows you to connect your plugin to a language file and support multiple languages for GUIs, messages, etc.!

##### and Utils:
- Easily send **chat messages** to players which can _execute code_ on click.
- **Serialize/Deserialize ItemStacks** via Base64
- Basic **Reflection** Utils
- **Skull texture** utils
- Basic **MySQL** connection (WIP)
